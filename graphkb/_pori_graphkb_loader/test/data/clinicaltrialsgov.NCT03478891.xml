    <textblock>
      Background:

      Ebola is a virus that has infected and killed people mostly in West Africa. There is no
      treatment or prevention for it, but several drugs are being studied. Researchers want to test
      the drug MAb114 in healthy people not exposed to Ebola to see whether it can be used for
      Ebola treatment in people who are infected in the future. This trial will not expose
      volunteers to the Ebola virus.

      Objectives:

      To see if MAb114 is safe and how a person's body responds to it.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18-60 who weigh 220.5 pounds or less

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under protocol NIH 11-I-0164 with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood or urine tests

      Participants will have a first 8- to10-hour visit. They will get MAb114 by IV infusion. For
      this, a thin tube will be placed in an arm vein. They may get an IV line in their other arm
      to collect blood. Blood will be taken many times before and after the infusion. Participants
      may have a urine test.

      Participants will get a thermometer to check their temperature for 3 days after they get
      MAb114. They will record their highest temperature and any symptoms.

      Participants will have about 14 more study visits over 6 months. At each visit, they will
      have blood taken and be checked for any health changes. They will talk about how they are
      feeling and if they have taken any medications.

      At the end of the 6 months, participants may be invited to take part in another study for
      follow-up sample collection.

      VRC 608: A Phase I, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a
      Human Monoclonal Antibody, VRC-EBOMAB092-00-AB (MAb114), Administered Intravenously to
      Healthy Adults

      Study Design: VRC 608 is the first-in-human Phase I study to examine safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of the monoclonal antibody (MAb), VRC-EBOMAB092-00-AB (MAb114). MAb114 will
      be administered as a single dose. The hypotheses are: 1) MAb114 administration to healthy
      adults will be safe by the intravenous (IV) route; and 2) MAb114 will be detectable in human
      sera with a definable half-life. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MAb114 in healthy adults. Secondary objectives will evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of MAb114 and the potential to detect an anti-drug antibody response to
      MAb114.

      Product Description: MAb114 is a human IgG1 MAb targeted to the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV)
      glycoprotein (GP). It was developed by the VRC/NIAID/NIH and manufactured at Cook Pharmica
      LLC d.b.a. Catalent Indiana, LLC (Bloomington, IN) under current Good Manufacturing Practice
      (cGMP) regulations. MAb114 is supplied as a lyophilized product in a glass vial at 400 mg per
      vial with target overfill to 425 mg per vial.

      Subjects: Up to 30 healthy adults, 18-60 years of age.

      Study Plan: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of MAb114 administered by IV
      infusion at dosages of 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg (Groups 1-3). Enrollment will begin with the lowest
      dose group. Following the first product administration in each group, the study team will
      wait at least 3 days before administering MAb114 to a second subject within the same group.
      Dose-escalation evaluations will occur to ensure the safety data support proceeding to the
      higher doses. Solicited reactogenicity following product administration will be evaluated
      using a 3-day diary. Assessment of safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of
      serum hematological and chemical parameters at defined timepoints throughout the study.

        -  Group 1: 3 subjects; 5 mg/kg IV

        -  Group 2: 5 subjects; 25 mg/kg IV

        -  Group 3: 10 subjects; 50 mg/kg IV

        -  Total* 18 subjects

             -  A minimum of 18 subjects will be enrolled. Enrollment up to a total of 30 subjects
                is permitted if additional subjects are necessary for safety or pharmacokinetic
                (PK) evaluations.

      Study Duration: Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks after the study product
      administration.

    <description>Possible infusion reaction symptoms: unusually tired/feeling unwell, muscles aches, headache, chills, rigors, nausea, fever, joint pain, urticaria/rash, and pruritus.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 3 Days of Product Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days after product administration</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects recorded 3-day systemic reactogenicity symptoms in a diary after study product administration. Solicited systemic symptoms include: unusually tired/feeling unwell, muscles aches, headache, chills, nausea, fever and joint pain. Subjects recorded highest measured temperature daily. Clinicians reviewed the diary with the subject and collected resolution information for any symptoms that were not resolved within 3 days. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects experiencing any systemic symptom as reported at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity was recorded without an attribution assessment. Grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.1.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 7 Days of Product Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after product administration</time_frame>
    <description>Local reactogenicity symptoms were assessed and recorded by clinicians. Solicited local symptoms include pain/tenderness, swelling, redness, bruising, and pruritus (itchiness) at the product administration site. Clinicians assessed the study product administration site for local symptoms on the day of product administration after completion of the administration and on Days 1, 2 and 7 post administration. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they experienced the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. If symptoms were experienced, clinicians collected resolution information for any symptom that wasn't resolved within 7 days. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any local symptom as reported at the worst severity. Solicited reactogenicity was recorded without attribution assessment. Grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.1.</description>

The number reported is the number of subjects who experienced at least one AE in the reporting period. A subject with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity. The relationship between an AE and the product was assessed by the investigator on the basis of his or her clinical judgment and the protocol-specific definitions of Related - There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study product and Not Related - There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study product.</description>
