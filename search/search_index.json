In general this consists of the following steps Parse HGVS-like notation 1 Disambiguate via ontologies (gene name, variant type, etc.) Pull matching variant records Refine matches base on position information 1 Follows inferences (ex. g. -> p.) Pull statements for these variant records This allows an input like KRAS:p.G12D to match to all eqiuvalent forms of this variant. For example, in the demo database it would result in the following matches How do I cite PORI? \u00b6 Please cite the following pre-print Reisle, et. al. 2021 . How Can I Migrate Our Existing KB to GraphKB? \u00b6 The simplest way to do this is using the API. THere are a number of examples of loader/migration scripts in the loaders project which can be used as examples as well as instructions on best practices for adding or including your own. If you would like a new loader for a public/popular resource, please make a ticket/issue on this github space Is there a Licensing Requirement for PORI Software? \u00b6 No. PORI is fully open source. The entire platform is released under a GPL-3 open source license. Is there a Licensing Requirement for PORI Data? \u00b6 Data is loaded and added externally by the users themselves and therefore there is no licensing requirement. We do provided loading scripts for some externally licensed content, but it is left up to the user to arrange and a license agreement for these sources if they would like to use them. By default the loaders only load the open data. How Can I Get Involved? \u00b6 We welcome and encourage community contributions! If you have a feature request, bug report, or question please feel free to submit an issue to our GitHub page. If you are not sure which repository to submit the issue to, use this main one by default and we will move or direct the issue as required. If you are a developer and would like to directly add and work on features, please submit a ticket for any new features and indicate that you would like to complete it or comment on an existing ticket. Following discussion with the main developers you should fork the repository and then submit a pull request from your forked version to the main repository. Please see the developer contributing guidelines here How Can I Try This Out? \u00b6 We have created a demo version of PORI for users to test without having to set anything up. Please see the IPR and GraphKB demos here What is Second-Pass Matching? \u00b6 Second-pass matching is built into the matching done by the IPR python adapter. First, variants are matched to statements. A second set of variants is then created using the subject and relevance of these matched statements. These newly created variants are passed back into matching to fetch statements. Any statements which are matched based on this second pass are labelled in IPR with the \"inferred\" flag. An example of this might be that a user inputs a variant, KRAS:p.G12D, which matches to a statement with a relevance of \"gain of function\" and a subject of \"KRAS\". This then creates the new variant \"KRAS gain of function\" which matches to a second statement with the subject \"EGFR inhibitor\" and relevance \"resistance\". An inferred match of EGFR inhibitor resistance will be reported for KRAS:p.G12D. Only applicable to postional variants, these steps are skipped when matching category variants. \u21a9 \u21a9","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#how-does-variant-annotation-work","text":"Variants are annotated using the GraphKB Python Adapter via the GraphKB REST API.

However these are modularized across several repositories listed below. An overview of each project is given below. The projects are grouped by their type of development expertise. Front-End Web Development \u00b6 In general our web clients are written in javascript/typescript and use React , Material-UI , and webpack . There are two main web client projects as part of PORI GraphKB client \u00b6 The GraphKB client is the front-end web client for the GraphKB project. The client is used to explore and manage content within GraphKB. This is the primary way for knowledge base users to interact with GraphKB. It contains a graph-based view and support for common query operations. It also allows export of results up to 5K rows (larger exports should be done via the API). IPR client \u00b6 The IPR client is the front-end web application which consumes data from the IPR API. The primary function is the production and management of genomic reports. Case Analysts use the IPR client to curate and review reports prior to presentation to a molecular tumour board or dissemination. Back-End Web Development \u00b6 The REST APIs that are part of PORI are written in javascript and are run using NodeJS . Both are built on the popular Express framework. The database and corresponding object relational mapper (ORM) is where they differ. The IPR API uses Postgres and sequelize whereas the GraphKB API uses OrientDB and orientjs . Both APIs implement swagger/openapi documentation for developers using the APIs. GraphKB API \u00b6 GraphKB REST API and Graph Database. The GraphKB database is a graph database which is used to store variants, ontologies, and the relevance of these terms and variants. The KB uses strict controlled vocabulary to provide a parseable and machine-readable interface for other applications to build on. IPR API \u00b6 The Integrated Pipeline Reports (IPR) REST API manages data access to the IPR database. The API is responsible for storing and serving all data for reports. ETL / Data Loading \u00b6 The GraphKB project also includes a loaders package which is used to import content from external knowledge bases and ontologies into GraphKB. Writing these loaders requires a strong understanding of the knowledge graph structure of GraphKB as well as the structure of the target resource. The loaders are written in javscript to be able to leverage the parser and schema JS packages used by the API and client. They are run with NodeJS . A list of the popular supported inputs can be found in the loading data section . GraphKB Data Loaders \u00b6 GraphKB loaders is responsible for all data import into GraphKB. Automatic Import modules are provided for a variety of external ontologies and knowledge bases such as: Ensembl, Entrez Genes, RefSeq, HGNC, Disease Ontology, NCI Thesaurus, CIViC, DoCM, etc. Python Adapters \u00b6 The popularity of python in bioinformatics makes it one of the top choices for adapters. These adapters are written to help users integrate PORI into their existing bioinformatic workflows. They are published and installed via pip. pip install graphkb ipr A developer reference for these packages including the function signatures and package details can be found in the developer reference section here . GraphKB Python Adapter \u00b6 Python adapter package for querying the GraphKB API. See the related user manual for instructions on incorporating this into custom scripts. IPR Python Adapter \u00b6 Python adapter for generating reports uploaded to the IPR API. This python tool takes in variant inputs as tab-delimited files and annotates them using GraphKB. The resulting output is uploaded to IPR as a report. Additional report content such as images and metadata can be passed to be included in the report upload. PORI cBioportal \u00b6 This python adapter is intended to demonstrate creating a PORI report using data exported from a cBioportal instance. It uses the expression, copy number, fusion, and small mutation data as well as available metadata to complete the reports. Other Supporting Packages \u00b6 There are a number of packages that are split into separate projects so that they can be re-used across the other PORI projects. For example, the GraphKB parser is used by the GraphKB API, the GraphKB Client, and the GraphKB data loaders. GraphKB Parser \u00b6 A package for parsing and recreating HGVS-like variant notation used in GraphKB. This is used by both the API and client applications. Try it out online with RunKit GraphKB Schema \u00b6 The GraphKB Schema package defines the vertex and edge classes in the DB. It is used as a dependency of both the API and client applications.","title":"All PORI Repositories"},{"location":"repos/#all-pori-repositories","text":"The platform has two main components: a graph knowledge base ( GraphKB ), and a reporting application ( IPR ).

An overview of our developer guidelines and best practices is given below. Tests \u00b6 When new features are added, corresponding tests should be implemented as well. We use jest for both API and client testing. The client additionally uses React Testing Library . Tests for python adpators are written using pytest . Tests for all repositories will be automatically run as a part of their GitHub Actions plan. See the next section for more details. CI / CD \u00b6 Every PORI repository has a corresponding github actions plan. These plans automate running tests, testing that documentation will build, as well as building and deploying docker containers when relevant. In general the following patterns are used. On Push \u00b6 tests are run docker containers are built to test they can build without errors linting / style-checking is performed On Release \u00b6 Python Adapters are published to PyPI Docker containers are published to DockerHub Documentation \u00b6 Documentation is critical both for the developers and the users. Docstrings / Function Documentation \u00b6 Functions should contain docstrings. The most important part here is the short description of the purpose of the function. Python \u00b6 In python these use the Google style docstrings. These will be automatically parsed to include in the developer reference section of this site by the markdown_refdocs package. Any variables that are not self explanatory (ex. input_file_path ) should include a parameter description as well. Types do not need to be included where a typing annotation has been added in the function signature. Example of a well documented function def positions_overlap ( pos_record : BasicPosition , range_start : BasicPosition , range_end : Optional [ BasicPosition ] = None ) -> bool : \"\"\" Check if 2 Position records from GraphKB indicate an overlap Note: null values indicate not-specified or any Args: pos_record: the record to compare range_start: the position record indicating the start of an uncertainty range range_end: the position record indicating the end of an uncertainty range Raises: NotImplementedError: if a cytoband type position is given Returns: True if the positions overlap \"\"\" Javascript / TypeScript \u00b6 We also use docstrings here. However in contrast to python these are immediately outside the function instead of following the function definition. These docstrings follow JSDoc syntax. If types are included (typescript) in the code then the types can be omitted from the docstring itself. An example of a well documented function is given below /** * Convert parsed breakpoints into a string representing the breakpoint range * * @param {Position} start the start of the breakpoint range * @param {Position} [end=null] the end of the breakpoint range (if the breakpoint is a range) * @param {boolean} [multiFeature=false] flag to indicate this is for multi-feature notation and should not contain brackets * * @returns {string} the string representation of a breakpoint or breakpoint range including the prefix */ const breakRepr = ( start , end = null , multiFeature = false ) => { User Documentation \u00b6 The user documentation should be updated in the central PORI documentation repository (this repository) when any changes are made which will affect the users. Furthermore all releases should contain a summary of the major and minor changes in their release tag for users who may be following the github page. Code Style \u00b6 In general we try to use automated tools to enforce code style. This helps avoid adding extra work for the developers and also makes the style choices transparent and consistent. For javascript/typescript we use ESLint to enforce compliance. For python files we use Black . These checks are generally run and included in the automated builds. Branching Model \u00b6 We use a fairly standard branching model which includes a base development branch (develop) and a stable main branch (master). Feature and bugfix branches are created off develop. Release braches are created off develop (or master for a quick/hotfix) and then a PR is made to master. image credit : A successful Git branching model . Following a release, the master branch is merged back into the development branch. Releases \u00b6 General Release Process \u00b6 In the following running example we are making the release v5.2.0 Make a release branch off develop git checkout develop git pull git checkout -b release/v5.2.0 git push --set-upstream origin release/v5.2.0 Edit the version files (see Versioning below) Set up a pull request (PR) from the Release Branch to the Master Branch The PR description should match what the upcoming release notes will be. This gives the reviewers a chance to review the release notes as part of the PR review Once approved and merged, tag a release on master (see Release Notes ) Finally, make a PR from master to develop. This should just be called something like \"master back to dev\" and does not require a description Versioning \u00b6 Each project in PORI uses semantic versioning . For python projects this should be written in the setup.py script setup ( version = 'X.X.X' , ) And for javascript/typescript projects it will be found in the package.json/package-lock.json files { \"version\" : \"X.X.X\" , } Version for both will follow the <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH> pattern where Increment Type Types of Changes Description MAJOR Breaking Changes when you make incompatible API changes MINOR New Features or Significant Improvements when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner PATCH BugFixes or Minor/Trivial Improvements when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes (or other TRIVIAL changes. ex. fixing a spelling error in documentation) The tag (release) in github itself should begin with a v followed by the current version (ex. v5.2.0 ) Release Notes \u00b6 Try to group changes with Major or Breaking changes at the top, followed by new features and then bugfixes and improvements. This way the content the users are likely most interested in is at the top. Release notes should be added when the release is created via the github interface and look something like this Breaking Changes - TICKET-ID: A major breaking change New Features - TICKET-ID: Any additional functionality Improvements - TICKET-ID: Minor changes to existing functionality: ex. linting BugFixes - TICKET-ID: Any bugFixes All releases should be created off of the master branch.

An overview of some of the features of GraphKB are given below. Features \u00b6 Dual Aggregate and Standalone KB \u00b6 GraphKB functions both as an aggregate knowledge base as well as a standalone application. Data can be imported from many external sources (see the data loading page ), but it can also be input directly. This also allows users to make manual updates and changes to imported content which is helpful when there may be errors or missing data that needs to be addressed in a time-sensitive manner. Multiple Overlapping Ontologies \u00b6 GraphKB is unique among other knowledge base projects in its inclusion of ontology relations and subsquent real-time leveraging of their inherent graph structure. The simultaenous loading of multiple overlapping ontologies allows for better coverage of terms when loading data from resources without controlled vocabulary 1 . It also enables users to match the chosen ontology of the source resource when specified. Non-specific Variant Notation Allows Curating Novel Variants \u00b6 The goal of GraphKB is to allow users to input content and match the specificity that was given by the source that they are curating. For example if a source claims that any truncating mutation in a particular gene is damaging then we would like to put that in as any truncating mutation rather than create a list of known or previously seen truncating mutations. The motivation here is that then if a novel mutation appears which fits this categorization we will be able to match and annotate it as well. GraphKB accomplishes this both by extending HGVS to allow other coordinate systems (such as exons) but also through allowing categorical variants as seen in the next section. Support for Complex Variant Types \u00b6 Variants in GraphKB can be defined by a position (PositionalVariant) or a category (CategoricalVariant). While GraphKB supports the traditional variant types (ex. single nucleotide variants), it also supports any number of more complex variant types (ex. molecular signatures). These can be defined via the categorical variant types which require only a reference element and a variant type. The reference element would point to a gene in a traditional mutation but can also point to any ontology defined in the database which includes molecular signatures and biological pathways. The type is defined by the Vocabulary packaged with GraphKB as a JSON input and can be edited and added to through the user interface. GraphKB was designed with storing fusions and structural variants in mind. Each variant record includes two reference fields, the latter of which is most often null for other variant types. This allows us to specify the second gene with the same level of specificity as the first. Some examples of the various categorical variants that it is possible to create in GraphKB may be Reference1 Reference2 Type Description Homologous Recombination Deficiency null strong signature A strong HRD signature KRAS null gain of function mutation Any gain of function mutation in the gene, KRAS EWSR1 FLI1 fusion Any fusion between EWSR1 and FLI1 The vocabulary used to create signature variants has been organized to allow multiple levels of specificity. Similarly, common names of signatures have been organized and related to allow users to input the terminology used by the source they are curating. We include a molecular signatures ontology file in the GraphKB loaders repository for convenience. We welcome contributions and suggestions via that repository. Getting Started \u00b6 Users \u00b6 The simplest way to try out GraphKB is via the demo we provide here . simply click on the /graphkb link and enter the provided credentials ( graphkb_admin / graphkb_admin ). This will allow you to test out the application before having to set up your own instance. If your institution would like to host an instance of GraphKB please see the instuctions for developers and system administrators in the next section. Developers / Sys-Admins \u00b6 GraphKB can be installed/setup by itself or in combination with the PORI reporting application, IPR. To see instructions for setup of the complete platform please see the main install page . Loading Data \u00b6 When you setup/install GraphKB you will create a new and empty database. Most users will then want to load some standard content into their newly created instance. We have created scripts and modules to simplify this process. See the data loading page for more information. Using the Python Adapter \u00b6 The python adapter to GraphKB is provided for users who would like to incorporate an instance of GraphKB into their own scripts and pipelines. Additionally it is used by the IPR python adapter to connect to GraphKB. Reisle, C. et al.

This algorithm can be viewed interactively in GraphKB via the matching section of the about pages Definitions \u00b6 The entire knowledge base is defined as the graph, \\(G = (V, E)\\) . For any given query let the subgraph of \\(G\\) containing only vertices of the class type specified in the query (ex. Disease) be, \\(V_t\\) . All edges between these vertices are then categorized into two disjoint sets: synonym-like ( \\(E_{syn}\\) ) or inheritance-like ( \\(E_{inh}\\) ).

From here we will need to pull out the HGVSp notation. Since this is output from SnpEff we can refer to their documentation for how to parse this. According to their site this is the expected format of the EFF field which contains the HGVS notation. This field is pipe delimited inside parentheses. EFF= Effect ( Effect_Impact | Functional_Class | Codon_Change | Amino_Acid_Change| Amino_Acid_Length | Gene_Name | Transcript_BioType | Gene_Coding | Transcript_ID | Exon_Rank | Genotype_Number [ | ERRORS | WARNINGS ] ) Note : EFF is a deprecated field.

If you are not uploading to IPR you can leave variants in their original format instead. Note : Some of the fields (support counts) require picking the samples.

From here we will need to pull out the HGVSp notation. Since this is output from SnpEff we can refer to their documentation for how to parse this. According to their site this is the expected format of the EFF field which contains the HGVS notation. This field is pipe delimited inside parentheses. EFF= Effect ( Effect_Impact | Functional_Class | Codon_Change | Amino_Acid_Change| Amino_Acid_Length | Gene_Name | Transcript_BioType | Gene_Coding | Transcript_ID | Exon_Rank | Genotype_Number [ | ERRORS | WARNINGS ] ) Note : EFF is a deprecated field. Newer versions use the ANN field. Parsing should be similar. We define the following functions below to help with parsing the INFO fields in the VCF import re def parse_eff ( eff ): match = re . match ( r '^[^(]+\\((.+)\\)$' , eff ) if match : [ impact , functional_class , codon_change , aa_change , _ , gene_name , transcript_biotype , gene_coding , transcript_id , _ , genotype_allele ] = match . group ( 1 ) . split ( '|' )[: 11 ] changes = aa_change . split ( '/' ) protein_changes = [ p for p in changes if p . startswith ( 'p.' )] cds_changes = [ p for p in changes if p . startswith ( 'c.' )] return [ impact , gene_name , transcript_biotype , gene_coding , transcript_id , protein_changes [ 0 ] if protein_changes else None , cds_changes [ 0 ] if cds_changes else None , genotype_allele ] raise NotImplementedError ( 'cannot parse eff string. Does not match the expected pattern' ) Now we want to convert the parsed content into a JSON/Dict to match the fields that we expect in IPR. If you are not uploading to IPR you can leave variants in their original format instead. Note : Some of the fields (support counts) require picking the samples. By default we have assumed the names are NORMAL and TUMOR.

This tutorial will cover basic matching of variants using the python GraphKB adapter against an instance of the GraphKB API. Users must first have login credentials to an instance of GraphKB API (or use the demo server). Note for users using the demo credentials and server, the data is limited and more complete annotations would be expected for a production instance of GraphKB. For the purposes of this tutorial we will be matching the known KRAS variant p.G12D to the demo instance of GraphKB. You can adjust the API instance by changing the setup variables below To run this locally, download this file and start the server from the command line as follows jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb You should now be able to see the notebook by opening http://localhost:8888 in your browser ! pip3 install graphkb Looking in indexes: https://pypi.bcgsc.ca/gsc/packages/ Requirement already satisfied: graphkb in /projects/dat/workspace/creisle/graphkb/graphkb_python (1.5.1) Requirement already satisfied: requests<3,>=2.22.0 in /projects/dat/workspace/creisle/graphkb/graphkb_python/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from graphkb) (2.22.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing_extensions<4,>=3.7.4.2 in /projects/dat/workspace/creisle/graphkb/graphkb_python/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from graphkb) (3.7.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /projects/dat/workspace/creisle/graphkb/graphkb_python/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests<3,>=2.22.0->graphkb) (2020.4.5.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<2.9,>=2.5 in /projects/dat/workspace/creisle/graphkb/graphkb_python/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests<3,>=2.22.0->graphkb) (2.8) Requirement already satisfied: chardet<3.1.0,>=3.0.2 in /projects/dat/workspace/creisle/graphkb/graphkb_python/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests<3,>=2.22.0->graphkb) (3.0.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3!=1.25.0,!=1.25.1,<1.26,>=1.21.1 in /projects/dat/workspace/creisle/graphkb/graphkb_python/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests<3,>=2.22.0->graphkb) (1.25.9) WARNING: You are using pip version 19.2.3, however version 21.0.1 is available.

In GraphKB we can leverage the ontology structure instead. In this example we will look for all terms that would indicate a therapeutically relevent statement. To do this we pick our 'base' terms. These are the terms we consider to be the highest level of the ontology tree, the most general term for that category. from graphkb.vocab import get_term_tree BASE_THERAPEUTIC_TERMS = 'therapeutic

specification at /api/spec . Here we will cover just the query endpoint which is the most commonly used endpoint as it is used for all searches. The /query endpoint accepts a JSON body in a POST request. This is how the user passes filters and other search-related parameters. We will define a few of the important fields and concepts that are used below. All the running examples below use the python GraphKB adapter. This assumes the user has aready initialized the connector and logged in as shown below (using the demo database and credentials). First install the adapter ! pip install graphkb Collecting graphkb Downloading graphkb-1.5.4-py3-none-any.whl (33 kB) Requirement already satisfied: requests<3,>=2.22.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from graphkb) (2.23.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions<4,>=3.7.4.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from graphkb) (3.7.4.3) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3!=1.25.0,!=1.25.1,<1.26,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests<3,>=2.22.0->graphkb) (1.24.3) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests<3,>=2.22.0->graphkb) (2021.5.30) Requirement already satisfied: chardet<4,>=3.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests<3,>=2.22.0->graphkb) (3.0.4) Requirement already satisfied: idna<3,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests<3,>=2.22.0->graphkb) (2.10) Installing collected packages: graphkb Successfully installed graphkb-1.5.4 Then set up the connector from graphkb import GraphKBConnection GKB_API_URL = 'https://pori-demo.bcgsc.ca/graphkb-api/api' GKB_USER = 'colab_demo' GKB_PASSWORD = 'colab_demo' graphkb_conn = GraphKBConnection ( GKB_API_URL ) graphkb_conn . login ( GKB_USER , GKB_PASSWORD ) Important Fields and Concepts \u00b6 Query Target \u00b6 The target is the class/table that the users wishes to query. If it is at the top level of the request body then it is also the type of record which will be returned. For example to get a list of all publications in GraphKB. We limit this to the first 3 publications for the purposes of this demo graphkb_conn . query ({ 'target' : 'Publication' }, paginate = False , limit = 3 ) [{'@class': 'Publication', '@rid': '#38:0', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612980878029, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'displayName': 'pmid:25500544', 'journalName': 'oncogene', 'name': 'the landscape and therapeutic relevance of cancer-associated transcript fusions.', 'source': '#17:21', 'sourceId': '25500544', 'updatedAt': 1612980878029, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25500544', 'uuid': '1294db97-ee26-4bd4-9b50-d122436905be', 'year': 2015}, {'@class': 'Publication', '@rid': '#38:1', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612981149054, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'displayName': 'pmid:16081687', 'journalName': 'blood', 'name': 'the jak2v617f activating mutation occurs in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, but not in acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.', 'source': '#17:21', 'sourceId': '16081687', 'updatedAt': 1612981149054, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16081687', 'uuid': '52e0d70f-07f8-48b9-b59d-b0258d60b9ae', 'year': 2005}, {'@class': 'Publication', '@rid': '#38:2', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612981150038, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'displayName': 'pmid:15146165', 'journalName': 'laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology', 'name': 'a great majority of gists with pdgfra mutations represent gastric tumors of low or no malignant potential.', 'source': '#17:21', 'sourceId': '15146165', 'updatedAt': 1612981150038, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15146165', 'uuid': '9e600c55-3247-4e24-bcd8-4a20bb0fb794', 'year': 2004}] Filters \u00b6 Any field that is accessible with the current users permissions level can be queried via this endpoint. Most commonly users want to filter on this like a records name or source ID (ID in the external database it was imported from). Continuing our example from above let's search for publications with the word \"cancer\" in them. Note : The current full text index only searches on word and word prefixes. Future iterations will support a full lucene index. graphkb_conn . query ({ 'target' : 'Publication' , 'filters' : { 'name' : 'cancer' , 'operator' : 'CONTAINSTEXT' } }, paginate = False , limit = 3 ) [{'@class': 'Publication', '@rid': '#38:0', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612980878029, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'displayName': 'pmid:25500544', 'journalName': 'oncogene', 'name': 'the landscape and therapeutic relevance of cancer-associated transcript fusions.', 'source': '#17:21', 'sourceId': '25500544', 'updatedAt': 1612980878029, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25500544', 'uuid': '1294db97-ee26-4bd4-9b50-d122436905be', 'year': 2015}, {'@class': 'Publication', '@rid': '#38:19', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612981162739, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'displayName': 'pmid:24666267', 'journalName': 'acta oncologica (stockholm, sweden)', 'name': 'the predictive value of kras, nras, braf, pik3ca and pten for anti-egfr treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'source': '#17:21', 'sourceId': '24666267', 'updatedAt': 1612981162739, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24666267', 'uuid': '06981f31-59d0-439e-b5cd-71f503f9c50e', 'year': 2014}, {'@class': 'Publication', '@rid': '#38:22', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612981164833, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'displayName': 'pmid:21030459', 'journalName': 'cancer research', 'name': 'the neuroblastoma-associated f1174l alk mutation causes resistance to an alk kinase inhibitor in alk-translocated cancers.', 'source': '#17:21', 'sourceId': '21030459', 'updatedAt': 1612981164833, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21030459', 'uuid': '4f088978-1736-4e3e-83fb-6d2c70e88873', 'year': 2010}] You can also filter on multiple conditions. To do this we nest filters in an object which uses a single AND/OR property with a list of regular conditions. For example if we want to find diseases with the name \"cancer\" or \"carcinoma\" graphkb_conn . query ({ 'target' : 'Disease' , 'filters' : { 'OR' : [ { 'name' : 'cancer' }, { 'name' : 'carcinoma' }, ] }, }) [{'@class': 'Disease', '@rid': '#43:99077', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612926192944, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': True, 'displayName': 'carcinoma', 'name': 'carcinoma', 'out_DeprecatedBy': ['#29:1400'], 'source': '#17:19', 'sourceId': 'doid:2428', 'updatedAt': 1612926192944, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'uuid': '2c61fd80-43fb-4cd2-941c-889a020cbbde'}, {'@class': 'Disease', '@rid': '#43:99076', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612926192912, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': True, 'displayName': 'carcinoma', 'name': 'carcinoma', 'out_DeprecatedBy': ['#29:1399'], 'source': '#17:19', 'sourceId': 'doid:6570', 'updatedAt': 1612926192912, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'uuid': 'baedee00-47a8-4d78-8ff5-7d9d8fadc03f'}, {'@class': 'Disease', '@rid': '#43:99072', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612926192816, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'description': 'A cell type cancer that has_material_basis_in abnormally proliferating cells derives_from epithelial cells.', 'displayName': 'carcinoma', 'history': '#43:107676', 'in_AliasOf': ['#26:160594', '#26:160595', '#26:160596'], 'in_DeprecatedBy': ['#29:1399', '#29:1400'], 'in_SubClassOf': [], 'name': 'carcinoma', 'out_CrossReferenceOf': ['#28:37788'], 'out_SubClassOf': ['#33:13951'], 'source': '#17:19', 'sourceId': 'doid:305', 'subsets': ['doid#do_flybase_slim', 'doid#ncithesaurus', 'doid#do_cancer_slim'], 'updatedAt': 1612980618003, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'uuid': '1775c2a3-b923-49f4-9e28-d5ccfcb32bc3'}, {'@class': 'Disease', '@rid': '#43:68962', 'alias': True, 'createdAt': 1612863235878, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'displayName': 'cancer [c9305]', 'name': 'cancer', 'out_AliasOf': ['#26:137530'], 'source': '#17:0', 'sourceId': 'c9305', 'updatedAt': 1612863235878, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'uuid': 'ed0fffc2-31ef-435b-ae11-6efd6b193dd3'}, {'@class': 'Disease', '@rid': '#43:100548', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612926228848, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'description': 'A disease of cellular proliferation that is malignant and primary, characterized by uncontrolled cellular proliferation, local cell invasion and metastasis.', 'displayName': 'cancer', 'history': '#43:107678', 'in_AliasOf': ['#26:161531', '#26:161532', '#26:161533'], 'in_SubClassOf': ['#33:5210', '#33:5268'], 'name': 'cancer', 'out_CrossReferenceOf': ['#28:37957'], 'out_ElementOf': ['#30:82543'], 'out_SubClassOf': ['#33:7594'], 'source': '#17:19', 'sourceId': 'doid:162', 'subsets': ['doid#do_flybase_slim', 'doid#ncithesaurus', 'doid#do_cancer_slim', 'doid#do_agr_slim', 'doid#do_gxd_slim'], 'updatedAt': 1612980640268, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'uuid': '6a051270-4611-4af2-a5ff-1b31a872b4e0'}] The operator can be omitted here since = is the default operator.

Subquery Filters \u00b6 Sometimes we would like to filter records on a linked field (essentially a foreign key).

Return Properties (Fields) \u00b6 The return fields property allows the user to specify what they would like to return. This can mean returning a subset of fields for a large query to improve the speed of the client digesting the data, or it can be used to de-nest fields. By default the query will return only the immediate properties of the class being queries. This means that linked fields will be listed as their record ID. De-nesting these fields allows you to return them without additional queries. graphkb_conn . query ({ 'target' : 'Disease' , 'filters' : { 'AND' : [ { 'source' : { 'target' : 'Source' , 'filters' : { 'name' : 'disease ontology' }}}, { 'name' : 'cancer' } ], }, }) [{'@class': 'Disease', '@rid': '#43:100548', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612926228848, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'description': 'A disease of cellular proliferation that is malignant and primary, characterized by uncontrolled cellular proliferation, local cell invasion and metastasis.', 'displayName': 'cancer', 'history': '#43:107678', 'in_AliasOf': ['#26:161531', '#26:161532', '#26:161533'], 'in_SubClassOf': ['#33:5210', '#33:5268'], 'name': 'cancer', 'out_CrossReferenceOf': ['#28:37957'], 'out_ElementOf': ['#30:82543'], 'out_SubClassOf': ['#33:7594'], 'source': '#17:19', 'sourceId': 'doid:162', 'subsets': ['doid#do_flybase_slim', 'doid#ncithesaurus', 'doid#do_cancer_slim', 'doid#do_agr_slim', 'doid#do_gxd_slim'], 'updatedAt': 1612980640268, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'uuid': '6a051270-4611-4af2-a5ff-1b31a872b4e0'}] We probably are not interested in all of these fields so let's pick a few to return. graphkb_conn . query ({ 'target' : 'Disease' , 'filters' : { 'AND' : [ { 'source' : { 'target' : 'Source' , 'filters' : { 'name' : 'disease ontology' }}}, { 'name' : 'cancer' } ], }, 'returnProperties' : [ 'name' , 'source' , 'sourceId' , 'alias' , 'deprecated' ] }) [{'alias': False, 'deprecated': False, 'name': 'cancer', 'source': '#17:19', 'sourceId': 'doid:162'}] The new return looks much more reasonable. However the source field right now is a seperate record ID. This means with the current query we would have to fetch that record separately if we want to see details about it.

De-nesting these fields allows you to return them without additional queries. graphkb_conn . query ({ 'target' : 'Disease' , 'filters' : { 'AND' : [ { 'source' : { 'target' : 'Source' , 'filters' : { 'name' : 'disease ontology' }}}, { 'name' : 'cancer' } ], }, }) [{'@class': 'Disease', '@rid': '#43:100548', 'alias': False, 'createdAt': 1612926228848, 'createdBy': '#14:0', 'deprecated': False, 'description': 'A disease of cellular proliferation that is malignant and primary, characterized by uncontrolled cellular proliferation, local cell invasion and metastasis.', 'displayName': 'cancer', 'history': '#43:107678', 'in_AliasOf': ['#26:161531', '#26:161532', '#26:161533'], 'in_SubClassOf': ['#33:5210', '#33:5268'], 'name': 'cancer', 'out_CrossReferenceOf': ['#28:37957'], 'out_ElementOf': ['#30:82543'], 'out_SubClassOf': ['#33:7594'], 'source': '#17:19', 'sourceId': 'doid:162', 'subsets': ['doid#do_flybase_slim', 'doid#ncithesaurus', 'doid#do_cancer_slim', 'doid#do_agr_slim', 'doid#do_gxd_slim'], 'updatedAt': 1612980640268, 'updatedBy': '#14:0', 'uuid': '6a051270-4611-4af2-a5ff-1b31a872b4e0'}] We probably are not interested in all of these fields so let's pick a few to return. graphkb_conn . query ({ 'target' : 'Disease' , 'filters' : { 'AND' : [ { 'source' : { 'target' : 'Source' , 'filters' : { 'name' : 'disease ontology' }}}, { 'name' : 'cancer' } ], }, 'returnProperties' : [ 'name' , 'source' , 'sourceId' , 'alias' , 'deprecated' ] }) [{'alias': False, 'deprecated': False, 'name': 'cancer', 'source': '#17:19', 'sourceId': 'doid:162'}] The new return looks much more reasonable. However the source field right now is a seperate record ID. This means with the current query we would have to fetch that record separately if we want to see details about it. This can be done in a single query with the nested return properties. Simply delimit properties and sub-properties with a period. graphkb_conn . query ({ 'target' : 'Disease' , 'filters' : { 'AND' : [ { 'source' : { 'target' : 'Source' , 'filters' : { 'name' : 'disease ontology' }}}, { 'name' : 'cancer' } ], }, 'returnProperties' : [ 'name' , 'source.name' , 'sourceId' , 'alias' , 'deprecated' ] }) [{'alias': False, 'deprecated': False, 'name': 'cancer', 'source': {'name': 'disease ontology'}, 'sourceId': 'doid:162'}]","title":"Return Properties (Fields)"},{"location":"graphkb/scripting/snpsift/","text":"Annotate SNPSift Files \u00b6 The script annotate_snpsift.py can be used to match variants from input files to an instance of GraphKB.

Formally it is defined as \\[ z = \\frac{\\mu - x}{\\sigma} \\] k-IQR \u00b6 The k interquartile range is a used to compare a point against a distribution. It is defined as the distance of a given point from the median scaled by the interquartile range \\[ k = \\frac{Q_2 - x}{Q_3 - Q_1} \\] This metric is similar to the z-score but more robust to outliers.

Comparators \u00b6 All of the standard expression metrics in IPR are expected to be calculated against a reference distribution of expression samples. To this end, IPR provides a number of fields to record which distributions were used. This ensures that the final result is interperable and reproducible.

For the purposes of this tutorial we want a smaller data set so we are going to choose the smallest TCGA cohort, CHOL. To do this we need to use the metadata file to subset the main matrix file Install Dependencies \u00b6 For the following tutorial we are going to use some common data processing and visualization libraries in python: seaborn and pandas.

Note : Differences in library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines can lead to variation in expression quantification. It is important to understand the impact these differences have on expression quantification before comparing expression values that are produced using different pipelines.

For the purposes of this tutorial we want a smaller data set so we are going to choose the smallest TCGA cohort, CHOL. To do this we need to use the metadata file to subset the main matrix file Install Dependencies \u00b6 For the following tutorial we are going to use some common data processing and visualization libraries in python: seaborn and pandas.

Note that differences in library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines can lead to variation in expression quantification. It is important to understand the impact these differences have on expression quantification before comparing expression values that are produced using different pipelines. For the purposes of this tutorial we are going to choose one of the CHOL samples from our expression matrix to use as our input. We arbitrarily choose the first sample. test_sample_id = str ( exp_matrix . iloc [ 0 ] . index [ 0 ]) meta_df [ meta_df [ 'sample' ] == test_sample_id ] .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } sample _PATIENT cancer type abbreviation age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis gender race ajcc_pathologic_tumor_stage clinical_stage histological_type histological_grade initial_pathologic_dx_year menopause_status birth_days_to vital_status tumor_status last_contact_days_to death_days_to cause_of_death new_tumor_event_type new_tumor_event_site new_tumor_event_site_other new_tumor_event_dx_days_to treatment_outcome_first_course margin_status residual_tumor OS OS.time DSS DSS.time DFI DFI.time PFI PFI.time Redaction 6583 TCGA-G3-A3CH-11 TCGA-G3-A3CH LIHC 53.0 MALE ASIAN Stage IIIA NaN Hepatocellular Carcinoma G2 2010.0 NaN -19473.0 Alive WITH TUMOR 780.0 NaN NaN Intrahepatic Recurrence Liver NaN 116.0 NaN NaN R0 0.0 780.0 0.0 780.0 1.0 116.0 1.0 116.0 NaN Now we compute the correlation of this sample with all other samples in the matrix excluding itself corr = exp_matrix [[ c for c in exp_matrix . columns . tolist () if c != test_sample_id ]] . corrwith ( exp_matrix [ test_sample_id ], method = 'spearman' ) . to_frame () corr = corr . rename ( columns = { corr . columns [ 0 ]: \"correlation\" }) . reset_index () . rename ( columns = { 'index' : 'sample' }) corr .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } sample correlation 0 TCGA-RP-A695-06 0.840728 1 TCGA-DD-AAW0-01 0.901187 2 TCGA-EE-A17X-06 0.825520 3 TCGA-DD-AACA-02 0.871860 4 TCGA-DD-AACA-01 0.883324 ... ... ... 930 TCGA-EE-A2GN-06 0.838558 931 TCGA-D9-A4Z6-06 0.824104 932 TCGA-EE-A29L-06 0.817158 933 TCGA-DD-A115-01 0.885494 934 TCGA-FV-A3I0-11 0.908514 935 rows \u00d7 2 columns Merge that with the metadata to group the correlations into their respective cohorts for plotting corr = corr . merge ( meta_df [[ 'sample' , 'cancer type abbreviation' ]], on = [ 'sample' ], how = 'left' ) corr .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } sample correlation cancer type abbreviation 0 TCGA-RP-A695-06 0.840728 SKCM 1 TCGA-DD-AAW0-01 0.901187 LIHC 2 TCGA-EE-A17X-06 0.825520 SKCM 3 TCGA-DD-AACA-02 0.871860 LIHC 4 TCGA-DD-AACA-01 0.883324 LIHC ... ... ... ... 930 TCGA-EE-A2GN-06 0.838558 SKCM 931 TCGA-D9-A4Z6-06 0.824104 SKCM 932 TCGA-EE-A29L-06 0.817158 SKCM 933 TCGA-DD-A115-01 0.885494 LIHC 934 TCGA-FV-A3I0-11 0.908514 LIHC 935 rows \u00d7 3 columns Now plot the correlations fig = sns . catplot ( kind = 'box' , data = corr , x = 'correlation' , y = 'cancer type abbreviation' ) title = test_sample_id + ' (' + meta_df [ meta_df [ 'sample' ] == test_sample_id ] . iloc [ 0 ][ 'cancer type abbreviation' ] + ')' fig . set ( xlabel = 'spearman correlation' , ylabel = '' , title = title ) <seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x7f3bc4d89350> As expected, the average pairwise correlation is highest within the same disease cohort as the sample Principle Component Analysis (PCA) \u00b6 The principal component analysis would serve a similar function to the pairwise spearman correlations plot above and could be included in place of said plot if preferred.

Note that differences in library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines can lead to variation in expression quantification. It is important to understand the impact these differences have on expression quantification before comparing expression values that are produced using different pipelines. For the purposes of this tutorial we are going to choose one of the CHOL samples from our expression matrix to use as our input. We arbitrarily choose the first sample. test_sample_id = str ( exp_matrix . iloc [ 0 ] . index [ 0 ]) meta_df [ meta_df [ 'sample' ] == test_sample_id ] .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } sample _PATIENT cancer type abbreviation age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis gender race ajcc_pathologic_tumor_stage clinical_stage histological_type histological_grade initial_pathologic_dx_year menopause_status birth_days_to vital_status tumor_status last_contact_days_to death_days_to cause_of_death new_tumor_event_type new_tumor_event_site new_tumor_event_site_other new_tumor_event_dx_days_to treatment_outcome_first_course margin_status residual_tumor OS OS.time DSS DSS.time DFI DFI.time PFI PFI.time Redaction 6583 TCGA-G3-A3CH-11 TCGA-G3-A3CH LIHC 53.0 MALE ASIAN Stage IIIA NaN Hepatocellular Carcinoma G2 2010.0 NaN -19473.0 Alive WITH TUMOR 780.0 NaN NaN Intrahepatic Recurrence Liver NaN 116.0 NaN NaN R0 0.0 780.0 0.0 780.0 1.0 116.0 1.0 116.0 NaN Now we compute the correlation of this sample with all other samples in the matrix excluding itself corr = exp_matrix [[ c for c in exp_matrix . columns . tolist () if c != test_sample_id ]] . corrwith ( exp_matrix [ test_sample_id ], method = 'spearman' ) . to_frame () corr = corr . rename ( columns = { corr . columns [ 0 ]: \"correlation\" }) . reset_index () . rename ( columns = { 'index' : 'sample' }) corr .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } sample correlation 0 TCGA-RP-A695-06 0.840728 1 TCGA-DD-AAW0-01 0.901187 2 TCGA-EE-A17X-06 0.825520 3 TCGA-DD-AACA-02 0.871860 4 TCGA-DD-AACA-01 0.883324 ... ... ... 930 TCGA-EE-A2GN-06 0.838558 931 TCGA-D9-A4Z6-06 0.824104 932 TCGA-EE-A29L-06 0.817158 933 TCGA-DD-A115-01 0.885494 934 TCGA-FV-A3I0-11 0.908514 935 rows \u00d7 2 columns Merge that with the metadata to group the correlations into their respective cohorts for plotting corr = corr . merge ( meta_df [[ 'sample' , 'cancer type abbreviation' ]], on = [ 'sample' ], how = 'left' ) corr .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } sample correlation cancer type abbreviation 0 TCGA-RP-A695-06 0.840728 SKCM 1 TCGA-DD-AAW0-01 0.901187 LIHC 2 TCGA-EE-A17X-06 0.825520 SKCM 3 TCGA-DD-AACA-02 0.871860 LIHC 4 TCGA-DD-AACA-01 0.883324 LIHC ... ... ... ... 930 TCGA-EE-A2GN-06 0.838558 SKCM 931 TCGA-D9-A4Z6-06 0.824104 SKCM 932 TCGA-EE-A29L-06 0.817158 SKCM 933 TCGA-DD-A115-01 0.885494 LIHC 934 TCGA-FV-A3I0-11 0.908514 LIHC 935 rows \u00d7 3 columns Now plot the correlations fig = sns . catplot ( kind = 'box' , data = corr , x = 'correlation' , y = 'cancer type abbreviation' ) title = test_sample_id + ' (' + meta_df [ meta_df [ 'sample' ] == test_sample_id ] . iloc [ 0 ][ 'cancer type abbreviation' ] + ')' fig . set ( xlabel = 'spearman correlation' , ylabel = '' , title = title ) <seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x7f3bc4d89350> As expected, the average pairwise correlation is highest within the same disease cohort as the sample","title":"Spearman Correlation"},{"location":"ipr/scripting/RNA_Expression_Similarity/#principle-component-analysis-pca","text":"The principal component analysis would serve a similar function to the pairwise spearman correlations plot above and could be included in place of said plot if preferred.
